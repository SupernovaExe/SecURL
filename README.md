SecURL is a web extension that utilizes machine learning to detect malicious URLs. It is non-intrusive such that it automatically fetches and evaluates the URL input by the user in a timely manner before directing them to the site.

### Features

- Automatic detection of malicious and benign URLs through machine learning.
- Personalized blacklisting.
- Customizable level of detection:
    - Faster but less accurate (using URL's lexical features)
